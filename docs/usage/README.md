# Usage

This section contains task-oriented guides for Pactole public APIs.

Use these pages as a practical path:

1. Build and validate combinations.
2. Evaluate ticket matches and winning ranks.
3. Work with lottery draw calendars and historical records.

The examples focus on realistic workflows (prepare a ticket, check upcoming draws,
search past results) rather than isolated API calls.

## Pages

- [Combinations](./combinations.md): Build tickets, normalize values, compare picks,
  and compute winning ranks.
- [Lottery classes](./lotteries.md): Configure lotteries, plan around draw days,
  generate plays, and query historical draw records.
